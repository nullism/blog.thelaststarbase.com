## Alpha Build 0.1.3

Added more polish and draw call optimizations. Was able to run the build on a 8 year old 1.8Ghz Intel Core 2&trade; PC with 2GB of RAM running Windows XP. It had an *integrated Intel Q965 graphics adapter with a **G3D Mark of < 100***! It didn't run well, but I was pleasantly surprised that it ran at all.
