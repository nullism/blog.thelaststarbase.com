## Hello, internet!

This blog shall serve as a place for posting updates and rants about our upcoming release *The Last Starbase*.

The basic premise of the game is as follows: 

* You have a starbase, and it's the last one. 
* The starbase can warp in and out of systems.
* You must collect resources and build defenses in these systems to survive an onslaught of angry AI ships.
* You collect resources to 
    * complete permanent upgrades to your starbase
    * build turrets, labs, and other structures
    * collect moar resources

It's basically an RTS / TD hybrid. We've been calling it an RTD. You have the resource management, base building, and enemy assault aspects
of an RTS, mixed with the waves and tower variety elements of a TD.

It's kind of unique as far as we could tell. 

Some mildly interesting and possibly unique features: 

* Turrets will automatically rebuild after being destroyed.
* Enemy "creeps" change in *type* instead of just having more health as waves progress.
* Weapon ranges are pretty large, hopefully giving the game a larger scale feel like Supreme Commander.
