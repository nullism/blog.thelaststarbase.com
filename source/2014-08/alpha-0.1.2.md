# Alpha Build 0.1.2

We were able to get some work done over the weekend. We're about 95% done with the actual engine logic.

Now we're focussed on the graphics and polish. Graphics areas include 3D models and
their textures, UI, skyboxes, and "hip" particle effects. Logic polish includes
network optimization, spawning optimization, adding the remaining units, 
building for multiple OS targets, and tons of balance tweeks. 

Features added in the 0.1.2 build:

* Wave Spawner
* Mass rate fix
* Energy rate fix

**PSA About Dropbox**

We were using Dropbox to sync our files between development machines, 
but Dropbox started zeroing out seemingly random files. 
Obviously, this was fairly frustrating, but nothing was lost.

We're working on switching to Git.
