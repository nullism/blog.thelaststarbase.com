## What's Next #1

### Wave Spawner AI

I'm dedicating most of my time developing the Wave Spawner AI. 
I call it "AI" because the Wave Spawner will choose which units to send
base on some parameters. The basic prototype uses a point system for each unit,
so a Capital Ship might cost 1000 points, but a fighter will only cost 10. The Wave Spawner
will purchase ships to send based on the number of points available, how many points it can
spend on a unit, and the makeup of towers (in hardmode, anyway).

I think this will be pretty cool &mdash; most of these types of games simply use a 
pre-programmed list of units to send. 

**tl;dr:** Adaptive Waves!
