# We've moved to Git

So... Dropbox was cool for a little bit, but it went a little crazy. 
Even now, there are still files that show 0 bytes on Dropbox.com, 
and both clients insist that these files are up to date. 

Moving to Git provides several advantages:

* First, it probably wont ruin our files.
* It allows testers to check out the code base and assets without breaking stuff.
* Unlike Dropbox, it's free. 

Anyway, Git has been pretty excellent so far. I recommend it.
